        I might be young and still lack in many things, but I belive age is not
        a hindrance to learn new things. To obtain a position where I can
        provide my knowlwdge, understanding and organizational skills. I am fond
        of doing editing, may it be Public Materials or contents for my personal
        portfolio. I am also a Director and Writer as well.
